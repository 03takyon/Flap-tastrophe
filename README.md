# Flap-tastrophe

Flap-tastrophe is a Flappy Bird clone built with Java and the LibGDX framework. This project was born out of curiosity and a desire to explore new tools, LibGDX being one I hadn't worked with before.

## Roadmap

* [x] Difficulty Scaling: Implement a dynamic difficulty system that ramps up the challenge as your score increases
* [x] Death Animation: Add a touch of drama with an animation when the player runs into a pipe
* [x] Code Optimization: Clean up the code to follow the DRY principle, so there's less repitition and more efficiency.
